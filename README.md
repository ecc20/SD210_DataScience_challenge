# Data Science challenge

In this two-member Machine Learning project, we worked on comparing pairs of images using scikit-learn and tensorflow.

We tested different algorithms such as Perceptron, SVM, Neural Networks, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoosting. We also tried to use data augmentation.

We fine-tuned the parameters to have the best accuracy possible. We achieved an accuracy of 0.9986. The best accuracy achieved in this challenge was 0.9988.
